``don’t be greedy sell at resistance``

 
`` DRAW SUPPORTS AND BUY ON SAFE CIRCES THT IS 20%-50% BELOW BASE (0.000600)->(0.000300) simply bole toh drop set 300 down pr buy start krna for not the good market, good mei toh 0.00600->0.00450 pr Abhi krdo ``
`` well support market mei if something falls it will come back to support``
`` support tells how many buyers in market , bcz support means a point where even
	if market falls will rise to the point and who will rise ? buyers? so to 
	mark good support, we see at which point in graph do buyers come in large quantity 
	to support market and the is our support . Bid 20% below it```
```major bounce recent==lot of buyers```
```just recent agr resistance koke bada rise hua toh isle invest krne ke lei
15min timeframe pr same technique```



****** bases should signify if there are buyers in the market******

percent and probab
probability is checked mainly at panic dips below suppot

panic on stocks which is well supported == jackpot

Buy on panic ppl

base/support == when something is falling and suddenly grup of ppl come to push it up meanig buyers exist, ie = good market to invest and iss market mei 
base sei neeche aate hi stsart buying (recent matter) view down
 
major panic's ke baad bhi agr market wapas aa parhii , koi support still exist , thn means there r lot of buyers => meaning 
pamic kei baad agr kabhi bhi market achi wali uthi hai recent mei hi mtlb buyers are there,(recent matter), so agle drop pr bid kro cuz recent hi drop hua tha and buyers nei utha lia tha
toh ab bhi utha hi lege

whenever putting a support/base just ask myself-> recent panic sei kya uth paya tha , cuz tht tells buyers are there ki nhi
and tht in term tell ki support aaega ki ni

safety mark : when there is panic , we have seen recent and know market will come up, the we put money on lower and expect to grow up to 
previous support, if it fails to reach support and tries to bounce up but not upto support and and falls again, means no , stop this trade now
sell all (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYMN0iVk5Ao)

when to invest= prev support set double niche jane pr

look for arguments recently, if there is no argument + graph almost constant the suddenly decrease and go below support set double as mentioned 
above, in this case don’t invest cuz maybe not right, han arg argument here recently, aha volume hai and nice market hai to many spikes hai recent mei
and constant market chi hai , the it means double set was pass aane pr from support buy 


if there is a rise unbelievable in a stock use same statergy as above
draw bases, bases set thud niche pr buy and sell as it reach almost some above support
lekin *** TRADING IN SUCH THINGS ARE QUICK , REACT FAST , thy go up and the go down fast, so 5min mei reaction time, so DONT TRADE UNTIL U HAVE TIME TO FULLY SEE ChART FOR 2HOUR AND REACT ASAP***
